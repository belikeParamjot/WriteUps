It's pretty weir because most of the people mailed me that this challenge was tough. Well tbh, it took me some time as well (~5 minutes XD). All you gotta do is go this wonderful site, and no matter what, in your CTF career never EVER forget the name of this site i.e. [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/). This site, contains awesome tools to solve almost every type of cipher.  
Just search for xor bruteforce, and you will come up to this [page](https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher). Here just paste the chunk of text from the challenge Message: and select the type to test all keys.

When you click the decrypt button, you will get a number of results on your left hand column. All you got to do is search on this webpage (on windows Ctrl+f and Command+f on Mac) for the string ```flag{``` and there is your only highlighted result.
