## Solution

If you don't know about wireshark or haven't used it before, I highly recommend you to check out [references](#References) before else you may not be able to understand what am I doing here.

So starting with the basic analysis: Let's apply filter for ```http``` first, because most of the communication is handled on this protocol.

Right click on the first packet > Follow > TCP stream. Now here start analyzing all the streams. Once you have gone through these streams, you might have noticed something suspicious on stream no. 5 with a GET request to address ```/?msg=ZmxhZ3tBRmxhZ0luUENBUH0=```.

This is a base64 cipher, after decrypting it... You will get your flag.

__Flag__: flag{AFlagInPCAP}
