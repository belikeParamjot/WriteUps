# Post Practice

This was really an easy challenge, I don't know why they put it in Medium difficulty. link: http://165.227.106.113/post.php

## Solution

When you inpect the site's source... It will give you the following comment:

```<!-- username: admin | password: 71urlkufpsdnlkadsf -->```

And the description says that you need to make a POST request. So I used ```curl``` here, to make that POST request providing the data given in the comment of the site.

```curl -X POST --data "username=admin&password=71urlkufpsdnlkadsf" http://165.227.106.113/post.php```
