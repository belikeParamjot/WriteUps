## Solution

If you don't have binwalk installed, you can install it with this command: ```sudo apt install binwalk```. It's great tool to work with, though it's really big to downlaod, so just wait, until it finishes installing. OR You can try using ```foremost```. Amazing and more efficient than binwalk, also really small to download and install and it comes handy as a pentester's tool to find the data inside a file. Anyways that's not what we are gonna do here but you can find more about it in the [refernce](#References) section below.  
When you type in your terminal: ```binwalk PurpleThing.jpeg``` it shows something strange png data hidden inside it.

So let's extract it with ```binwalk -e PurpleThing.jpeg```, after the process the data has been extracted, let's view it...

It's a png image that gave us the flag.
