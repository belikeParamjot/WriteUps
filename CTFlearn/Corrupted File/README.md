## Solution

Now tbh, whenever I see such challenges with name corrupted file... My eyes go to the meta header of the file... So when I downloaded the file... I saw the extension ```.gif```. So I went to this [site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures), and searched for GIFs.

Then I viewed the header of the file to check how much of the header is included. I found out that the header was completed with the bytes that were not similar i.e. GIF8 _9a_. So our only work to add the rest of the bytes of the gif header i.e. ___GIF8___

So I opened the file in vim with ```vim unopenable.gif```(or you can use any text editor to edit it) and added __GIF8__ in the beginning, which made it look like this.

Then save the file. When I opened it... It gave me the gif with the flag in base64 format. I then used this [site] where I uploaded the gif to reduce it's speed. Change the speed according to your convenience, and write the flag manually in your notepad which is displayed at a reduced speed.

Then decode the flag with the command ```echo "<string>" | base64 -d``` which gives you your flag.
