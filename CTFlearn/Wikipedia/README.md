## Solution

This challenge is a really good one, and if you don't know, this challenge helps you to know wikipedia better. Now, let's get onto the challenge, all we got to do is go to [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org/), and search the given IP in the search bar.

As you can see a user with this IP made a contribution to a wikipedia page. You can view the page in real time, but for the sake of this challenge, I am going to click on the ```diff``` link which will show me what the user really changed in the wikipedia page, at that time and at what line, just like the github keeps its log of changes made in the .git folder.
