## Solution

This challenge was pretty easy, but it took me a few extra minutes than usual. Anyhow, let's start with opening the file:

Huh! Strange, I guessed here to fix the png header to view the file... But that was a fail to me, than I used the strings to view the file and that gave me pretty interesting strings like these:

So I thought there must be some hidden files inside it, I used the ```binwalk -e <image>``` to extract all the files and then it gave me a folder in which these were the files:

Now I tried to view the _I Warned You.jpeg_ image also, but that also dint show anything, when I tried to fix its jpeg header, it was still not letting me view the image. At last I tried to use the strings command and grepped out the flag: ```strings <image> | grep -i ctf``` which gave me this:

__Flag__: ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}
