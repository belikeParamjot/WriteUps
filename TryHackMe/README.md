# TryHackMe
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is an online platform for learning and teaching cyber security, all through your browser. Some rooms here are free, but if you like the way they teach you can always have a monthly subscription to their premium services starting from 8$ a student, and I am pretty sure that it is very much affordable by everybody. I highly recommend you to get it.

## About the Repo
Now this repo is going to be divided into 2 sections:
  - [Walkthroughs](#Walkthroughs)
  - [Challenges](#Challenges)

### Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs are pretty easy, but just in case, you got stuck somewhere and needed help in completing the rest of the room, you can take this as a cheatsheet. Some of the times, you will see taken screenshots of my page in the solutions. _Exception: Not all rooms here are having direct answers to the respective task, so just be smart enough to find you way through;) But believe me, I made a way for you through the task._  
__Warning__: Be sure to know what you are doing, and I highly recommend you to scratch your head before looking to the direct solution. In cyber security, you will need these skills of finding/deriving answers of your own, so be honest to yourself and peek [here](#) only when necessary.

### Challenges
This section will be the crux of all the things in TryHackMe folder. Now especially this folder, won't be containing any flags, passwords, username, found directories, cracked hashes(will be blurred, or removed from screenshots just in case), because after all these challenges are here to test your skills. I will be uploading a detailed writeup to all the challenges(including the methodology I used to obtain the flag), but not something that can be used as a direct cheatsheet to the room.
You can find your writeups [here](#).

### Notice

Now as I told above, you won't be finding direct answers to your tasks but a detailed writeup, there might be a possibility, that those writeups ain't helpful to you and just in case you got stuck somewhere, feel free to reach out to me at either of the platforms:

Peace.
