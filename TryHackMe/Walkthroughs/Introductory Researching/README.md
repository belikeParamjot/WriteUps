### [Task #3] Vulnerability Searching
  Sorry, here you gotta work on your own pal, but to be clear... All answers you can find just by copy pasting the questions on google, or do it the geeky way, by going to [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/)

     What switch would you use to copy an entire directory?
