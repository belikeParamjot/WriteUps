# Basic Pentesting
This is a machine that allows you to practise web app hacking and privilege escalation  

## Enumeration

Nmap Scan:

The following ports were found open:
- SSH [22]
- SMB [139,445]
- HTTP [80,8080]
- AJL13 [8009]

Gobusting:

The following hidden directory was revealed:
- /development

When I reached out to that directory it gave me 2 txt file.

1 gave me hint that the applied password policy of agent J is weak... and another gave me the versions of the services that are implemented in site.

### Username Enum

After a while I started to enumerate the usernames via hydra but that didn't work... Scratched my head a bit and started to enumerate the machine via smb, using ```enum4linux -a <IP>```. It found two users on the box i.e. kay and jan.

## Gaining Access
I bruteforced the username jan with a list of passwords using hydra on port 22 i.e. ssh, which eventually gave me the password ```armando```.

After logging in via ssh, I rome around a bit, found as little as nothing. I then found that we have another user called kay on the machine. So I went into his directory, found a file ```pass.bak```, unfortunately we don't have read access to the file, so I went in ```.ssh``` directory found a encrypted private key.

## Escalating Privileges
 Cracking the Private Key

I copied the encrypted key, paste it in a file and used john on it.  Firstly, converting the encrypted file into john crackable format using the command ```sudo /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py <file with encrypted key> > <output file>```. After that run john on the output file.

Using this password we can decrypt the private key in the .ssh directory of the user kay.

After gaining access to the user kay, read the pass.bak file and you will be given answer to the last task.
